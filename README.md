# matrix-appservice-irc-harness
Testing harness for the Matrix IRC Appservice. The service can be found https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc

## Goals

The point of this project is to run the appservice against a real (albeit local) irc server for the purposes of performance testing and load testing. This differs in that we do not inspect the running bridge and instead generate stats through metrics.
